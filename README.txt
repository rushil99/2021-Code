myshell.c is a shell made with using c language. It does simple things such as ls, fork
showing things in the directory and much more. Its mainly broken up into while loops 
and alot of if else loops. When there is no lines of code it will just wont ouput anything. There is also a limit of
how many words you can type in a line before it breaks the loop. 
Mainly the bug i had was it wouldnt read anything after the semicolon but other then that
everything works. The two modes work properly as well its only the semicolon bug.
